# Price Optimization for SaaS Product

## Challenge

The founding team wanted a first fully-scalable product from what they had envisioned from day 1. They wanted a product that would fetch different data sources, apply several machine learning models to them, optimize prices across different goals and constraints, and push prices back to the e-commerce platform.

## Design

Built an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for dynamic pricing optimization using quantile regression as baseline and 
Lagrangian methods. The system processes e-commerce data through automated workflows, 
trains demand curve models, and applies multi-objective optimization strategies (profit 
maximization, sales growth, constraint-based) to generate optimal pricing.

## Result

The system was able to generate optimal pricing for the e-commerce platform, with a 35% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in sales.

## Takeaway

Taking the founding team's vision and early design to a fully data-intensive product and iterating over customer feedback unlocked new revenue streams for the company.

# AI Matching Engine for Manufacturing Company

## Challenge

Technical and C-level stakeholders were dealing with the consequences of 200,000 duplicate and incomplete records across several key units of the company, making this a critical issue that had to be dealt with from the ground up.

## Design

A machine learning-driven matching engine, combined with human-in-the-loop logic, successfully categorized matches with high confidence and restored CRM single source of truth.

## Result

The system was able to restore CRM single source of truth, reducing duplicate and incomplete records by 70% and saving +1 FTE worth of manual effort.

## Takeaway

Workshops with key stakeholders who understood the business context were crucial to building this solution. Knowing where to separate AI tasks from human tasks was critical to success.

# Earnings Call Dashboard for Private Equity Firm

## Challenge

Financial research firm needed a dashboard to process earnings calls from 500+ portfolio companies, extracting key insights and predicting sentiment with vocal tone AI models.

## Design

We built a backend in charge of extracting transcripts and audio data from recent earnings calls and then feeding this to LLMs and vocal tone models to trigger inference on sentiment and key insights.

## Result

The dashboard is now serving as key alert tooling for portfolio managers, enhancing their decision making on the fly.

## Takeaway

Being able to visually display negative and positive alerts across multiple companies was a key differentiator for the firm.
