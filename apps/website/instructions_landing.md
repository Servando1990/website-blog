# Astro + shadcn/ui SaaS Landing Page

Create a minimalistic landing page with the current layout of index.html

Use astro islands for the interactive components and easy content management.

Use shadcn/ui for the UI components and styling.

Use tailwing css for the styling.

Use astro for the framework.
Use vercel for the deployment.

VERY IMPORTANT:
DO NOT DIFFER OR ADD MORE COMPOENENTS THAN THE CURRENT LAYOUT.
I need to approve the design before addigng more pages or components.

Reduce the the usage of images to the bear minimum. This is a minimalistic text-based modern website.

Replace images with subtle shadcn/ui icons.

Only keep the images of the companies logos
