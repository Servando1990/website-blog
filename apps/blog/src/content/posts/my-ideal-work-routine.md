Some of this is real, some of this is aspirational. Here's what my ideal workday looks like:

**6:30-7:00am — Slow mornings**
Wake up without rushing. Stretch, breathwork, quality time with my wife. We make specialty coffee together around 8am.

**8:00-10:00am — Gym session**
Powerful workout to start the day strong. Come back energized, have breakfast, and sit down at my desk by 10am.

**10:00am-2:00pm — Deep focus hours**
This is when I'm sharpest. Client work and software development tasks get priority. No big lunch—just a small snack (toast, fruit) around midday to maintain energy without crashing.

**2:00-6:00pm — Flexible work mode**
Option to head to a co-working space for fresh air and social energy. More creative work: calls, emails, roadmaps, Discord/Slack activity. Curate content, update Linear, post on LinkedIn.

**Dream workspace**
Big windows, natural light, great view. Herman Miller standing desk and chair. Beautiful monitor with speakers. Tony Stark-level gear to feel ready for anything.

**7:00-8:00pm — Dinner with my wife**
The most important part of my day. Cook together, share a nutritious meal, talk about our days. No late dinners—better for health and sleep.

**9:00pm+ — Wind down**
Optional: finish last task of the day. Or stop there and spend time together—cleaning up, cuddling, watching Netflix.

The balance between deep work, social energy, and quality time with my wife is what makes this routine ideal.
