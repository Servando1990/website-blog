## Life story

I was born in Puebla, Mexico. For people always asking: where is it? I always say "it's close to Mexico City". My dad is a retired doctor and my mom was dentist. She died of cancer when I was in my early twenties (I have blurred memory of that period of my life). My dad always said that when I was a kid I was always on my own. I used get lost a big supermarkets, my mom would freak out but I'd would always be at the toy section, looking closely at the boxes of new toys as I would enjoy reading every detail about this new toy.

Growing up, I had always been intersted in business and art. I used sketch with charcoal, write poetry and kind of write lyrics. I did OK during high-school, math was always a big pain of mine, but I quite enjoyed statistcs, There wa a subject called "business english" wich I was particuarly good at, mainly because because, we used to go trhough business case studies and talk about the problem and come up with a solution. 

Finding out who am I was the ultimate quest during my teenage and twenties. My freinds were from differnet social groups, hoping to see more... The idea of having just one path or one way to do certain things was unthinkable to me and freindship was the first evidence of this. I went to Brazil right before starting to university and it changed everything to me. If could summarize that year in one sentence it would be: "There are kids doing completley different things than me" changed me forever.

In Mexico, you can choose a "path" in the last year of high-school to help you "prepare" for univeristy. I choose "business" because "engineering" seem to hard and I was too lazy and "arts" seemed not very useful for my future. Not very convinced what I'd choose for my carreer and the status-quo behind my back saying "next year is University, you better choose" Business Trade was a good option. It involved economics, international trade and cross-cultural studies. I graduated with good grades and even won a small unversity help to cover for my exchange semester in Germany.

I had small taste of entreprenuership after collague, me and friend were working in a project we called "Mobile stores". That chapter was very fun, it gave me the ability to dream big. I used to say "We are going to take down Walmart". Exploring was a heavier feeling than starting a company back then, and the only vehicle I saw to see what is out there was to keep on with my studies. I was not a big deal, I like to learn new stuff. Found myself in one this university fairs where they give you nice brouchers with different programs and nice campus pictures. One of them cought my attention: "Big Data and Business Intelligence". The skill of manipulating large amounts and data and derive intelligence convinced to the point I sold my car, move to Madrid and my passion for tech started.

## Summer of Machine Learning

I was obssed with ML and its implications with in the real industries, after I graduated form that program I made an excel spreadsheet with a very comprehensive list of things I missed from my studies and decided to self-study everything I could within a timeline of 3 months - it was that summer. During my studies I went full-nerd and dedicate my entire time to extract all the knowledge I had not only from the classes but also from engagigng with my professors. Looking back, I think I was very annoying. Graduated with excelent notes but it was not enough to get a job in tech, not comming from STEAM field made things difficult but not impossible.
