#TODO: Find patterns to replace over usage of "I"
#TODO: Add rule for paragraph length. In the blog post the lenght is smaller than the raw markdown file.

## Life story

I was born in Puebla, Mexico. For people always asking: where is it? "close to Mexico City" is my gold standard answer. My dad is a retired doctor and my mom was dentist. She died of cancer when I was in my early twenties (I have blurred memory of that period of my life). My dad always said that when I was a kid I was always on my own. Getting lost a big supermarkets was common -my mom would freak out but I'd would always end up at the toy section, looking closely at the boxes of new toys as I would enjoy reading every detail about this new toy.

Growing up, I had always been intersted in business and art. I used to sketch with charcoal, write poetry and "kind of" write lyrics. I did OK during high-school, math was always a big pain of mine, but I quite enjoyed statistics, There was a subject called "business english" wich I was particuarly good at. We used to go through business case studies, talk about some problem and come up with a solution. 

Finding out who am I was the ultimate quest during my teenage and twenties. My friends were from differnet social groups. Looking back, the thouught I had was "to see more". The idea of having just one path or one way to do certain things was unthinkable to me, and freindship was the first evidence of this. I went to Brazil right before starting university and it changed everything to me. If could summarize that year in one sentence it would be: "There are kids doing completley different things than me" changed me forever.

In Mexico, you can choose a "path" in the last year of high-school to help you "prepare" for univeristy. I choose "business" because "engineering" seem to hard and I was too lazy and "arts" seemed not very useful for my future. Not very convinced what I'd choose for my carreer and the status-quo behind my back saying "next year is University, you better choose" Business Trade was a good option. It involved economics, international trade and cross-cultural studies. I graduated with good grades and even won a small unversity help to cover for my exchange semester in Germany.

I had small taste of entreprenuership after collague, me and friend were working in a project we called "Mobile stores". That chapter was very fun, it gave me the ability to dream big. I used to say "We are going to take down Walmart". Exploring was a heavier feeling than starting a company back then, and the only vehicle to achieve that, was to keep on with my studies. It was not a big deal, I like to learn new stuff. Found myself in one this university fairs where they give you nice brouchers with different programs and nice campus pictures. One of them cought my attention, it has the term "Big Data", which triggerd my full curiosity, and then the thought of having the skill of manipulating data and derive intelligence convinced to the point I sold my car, move to Madrid and my passion for tech started.

## Summer of Machine Learning

I was obssessed with ML and its implicationns, in the real industries, after I graduated form that program I made an excel spreadsheet with a very comprehensive list of things I missed from my studies and decided to self-study everything I could within a timeline of 3 months - it was that summer. 

During my studies I went full-nerd and dedicate my entire time to extract all the knowledge I had not only from the classes but also from engagigng with my professors. Looking back, I think I was very annoying. Graduated with excelent notes but it was not enough to get a job in tech, not comming from STEAM field made things difficult but not impossible.

## Fulfilling career in ML

Not verticalized and quite broad, can be an accurate description of my time working in tech and ML. Started writing SAS code in Banking and Telco, learned the principles of "always asking why we are doing things and its impact". 

And old mentor of mine thought to see beyond the code I was writing and focus more on the impact I was delivering, started to prototype classification models for churn detection and and risk. Technical consulting kept broading my technical and industry toolkit. I spend some time deploying models for Insurance companies, writing operation-research Scala code models for manucaturing and learning best practices for building MLOps pipelines. This generalist approach helped me polish my skills to be a fast learner and more importantly find common patterns in solutions abstracting away the industry specific details.

## Reset & Entrepreneurship

Not being super clear on where I was heading professionally, and suffered from a small burn-out. I had to a personal crisis on top of that, that lead me to go back to Mexico. Looking back, it was a great experience that needed to happen, I had to slow down, travel around my country and decide what I wanted to do next.

Building a business started to appear closer to my radar, because I moved to a different city. The signals were there, networking events, conferences, meeting driven people chasing their goals. It was like a moth to a flame, I was drawn to it. So after I had my last sips of 9-5 life, I decided to start the independent path.

## Betting on building something on my own

During my years working in consulting and startups I always saw the same issue: I big gap alignment between techincal and business areas. One day when I was running near to the beach I came up with the name "controlthrive", which in my is having a good sense of control of your software to thrive in what is really important, your business. 

Since then, I help subject matter leaders map their business process, come with custom software that they understand from inception and its alignedC with what they are looking to accomplish.
