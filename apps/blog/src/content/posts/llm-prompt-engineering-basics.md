# LLM Prompt Engineering: The Basics

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs for large language models (LLMs). It's become a crucial skill for anyone working with AI systems.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves designing inputs that guide LLMs to produce desired outputs. It's about:

- **Clarity**: Making your intent clear
- **Context**: Providing relevant background
- **Structure**: Organizing information logically
- **Constraints**: Setting boundaries and expectations

## Key Techniques

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

❌ **Vague**: "Write about AI"

✅ **Specific**: "Write a 500-word introduction to machine learning for beginners, focusing on supervised vs unsupervised learning"

### 2. Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

```
Classify the sentiment of these reviews:

Review: "This product is amazing!"
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "Terrible quality, wouldn't recommend"
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It's okay, nothing special"
Sentiment: [YOUR CLASSIFICATION HERE]
```

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of asking for everything at once, break complex requests into steps:

1. First, analyze the problem
2. Then, propose solutions
3. Finally, evaluate each solution

### 4. Set the Context and Role

```
You are an expert data scientist with 10 years of experience.
A beginner asks you: "What's the difference between precision and recall?"
Explain it in simple terms with examples.
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Being too vague** - LLMs need clear instructions
- **Overloading with information** - Too much context can confuse
- **Not iterating** - First attempts rarely work perfectly
- **Ignoring model limitations** - Remember what the model can and can't do

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** and add complexity gradually
2. **Test variations** of your prompts
3. **Use delimiters** to separate different parts
4. **Ask for step-by-step reasoning** when needed
5. **Specify the output format** you want

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting

Ask the model to think step-by-step:

```
Let's think through this step by step:
1. First, identify the key components
2. Then, analyze their relationships
3. Finally, draw conclusions
```

### Constitutional AI

Include principles for the AI to follow:

```
Follow these principles:
- Be helpful and accurate
- Acknowledge uncertainty when unsure
- Provide balanced perspectives
- Cite sources when possible
```

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is both an art and a science. The key is to experiment, iterate, and learn from what works. As LLMs continue to evolve, so will the techniques for working with them effectively.

Remember: the best prompt is the one that consistently gets you the results you need.
