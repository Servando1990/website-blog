# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome! I'm excited to start this journey of sharing my thoughts, experiments, and learnings in the world of artificial intelligence and technology.

3. Connect with like-minded people
4. Document my learning journey

## The Journey Ahead

I'm planning to write regularly about:

- LLM applications and prompt engineering
