About me 

Hi, I'm Servando Torres. I'm self-taught ML Engineer born in Mexico. I love good quality code, learning about different industries, building companies and AI. 

Day by day I'm mastering the skill retrieving and mapping as much value as possible from talking to people. So I can quickly understand gaps and accuratly provide solutions.

My dream was always to be an entreprenuer. This blog  is my way to share my joounrey building [controlthive](https://controlthrive.com), share technical content and every now an then personal learnings.

Another dream of mine is to become a dad and a caring husband ðŸ˜Š

I'm always open to connect with people likeminded so feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://x.com/vandotorres) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/servandotorres/).
